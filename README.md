  ## Usage  
  Upon visiting the [linked page](https://ihm57511.github.io/employee-directory/), the user may look through the employee database. If so desired, the table of employees may be sorted alphabetically by last name, in ascending or descending order, by clicking the table header "Name". Similarly the other titles may be selected to sort by phone number, email, or date of birth. The data may also be narrowed by typing in a specific name or partial name in the search field.
